GNU/Linux & Freesoftware
===

I'll list some of my favorite software in this page.
They are impressive in functionality or effective
in improving work efficiency.

### Terminal Emulators

`konsole` > `tilix` > *

* `konsole` works well under any desktoop environment.
This teerminal emulator is very fast and able to deal
with a large amount of screen outputs. The fastest
terminal in my impression is `xterm` or `uxterm`, but
it lacks too many features.

* `tilix` is my favorite terminal under Gnome3. It is
feature-rich and is well-integrated into Gnome3.

### Shell

Shell: `fish` > `zsh` > `bash`

### Terminal Multiplexer

Terminal Multiplexer: `tmux` > `screen`

### Editor

* Editor: `vim`

### Graphical Environment

 `Gnome 3` > `dwm` (suckless.org) > *

### Drawing

Drawing: `inkscape`, `gimp`

### Input Method

Chinese Input Method: `fcitx5`

### Web Browser

Web Browser: `firefox-esr` > `firefox` > *
