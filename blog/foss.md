GNU/Linux & Freesoftware
===

I'll list some of my favorite software in this page.
They are impressive in functionality or effective
in improving work efficiency.

### Terminal Emulators

* `konsole` > `tilix` > *

`konsole` works well under any desktoop environment.
This teerminal emulator is very fast and able to deal
with a large amount of screen outputs. The fastest
terminal in my impression is `xterm` or `uxterm`, but
it lacks too many features.

`tilix` is my favorite terminal under Gnome3. It is
feature-rich and is well-integrated into Gnome3.

### Shell

`fish` > `zsh` > `bash`

### Terminal Multiplexer

* `tmux` > `screen`

### Editor

* `vim` > *

I'm a super fan of Vim. Being able to code without the mouse is a happy
feeling.

### Desktop Environment

* `dwm` (suckless.org) > `Gnome3`  > *

Although my daily desktop environment is generally Gnome3, my favorite working
environment is actually the tiling window manager `dwm` from `suckless.org`.
It is written in about a thousand lines of C code, and hence is not a
feature-rich `desktop environment`, but merely a barely simple window manager.
`dwm` endows me the power to control graphical windows without the mouse (with
tmux things can be even better) when working in the terminals. Besides,
although lacking many desktop features, `dwm` allows me to better focus on one
thing. I like to use `compton` in conjunction with `dwm` for the fade-in/out
effect. Customization of `dwm` can be done via editing the C source code.

### Drawing

* `inkscape`

* `gimp`

### Input Method

* `fcitx5`

### Web Browser

* `firefox` > *
