Software Freedom | 软件自由

### IMHO

* Free software is also free of charge.  
* Free software allows you to see through the essential of a software -- endows you with full freedom to study how a program works, instead of hiding all technical details beneath a unbreakable skin.  
* Free software endows you with the power to completely override the software decision -- you may permanently disable it from mandatory automatic upgrades, which interrupts your on-going-work and disrespects your insist on not upgrading.  
* Free software gives you the power to let it shut up and stop poping up any information to you, interrupting your focus.  
* Free software comes without warranty. It is not guaranteed to be easy to use, especially when compared to paied proprietary software.  
* Free software forms a helpful community -- we work together towards a common belief, just for fun.  
* Free software accurately executes your commands -- it neither does a bit more, nor a bit less. It is not naughty.  
* Free software might be buggy and out of enough maintenance crew to fix it.

### Appendix: Official explaination

https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html

A program is free software if the program's users have the four essential freedoms:

* The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).  
* The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.  
* The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).  
* The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
